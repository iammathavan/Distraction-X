# Distraction X (Chrome Extension)

This is a Chrome Extension that helps with avoiding distracting websites. Users can paste any website link in the input field and click submit. After, the user can set up any time they wish using the time buttons. Once started, the time will keep running; the user can't access their submitted websites during that time. The user can stop the time and then visit those links or visit those links only after the timer runs out.
